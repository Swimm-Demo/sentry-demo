# Purpose of the Web Vitals Detail Overview

The Web Vitals Detail Overview is a feature in the Sentry application that provides an overview of web vitals details. It is designed to help users understand the performance of their web applications by providing insights into key web vitals metrics.

# How the Web Vitals Detail Overview fetches and processes data

The Web Vitals Detail Overview fetches and processes data using several hooks and queries. It fetches categorized samples of transactions and interactions, web vitals scores for a project, and raw web vitals data for a project. The data is then processed and used to render different parts of the user interface.

# Impact of the Web Vitals Detail Overview on the end user

The Web Vitals Detail Overview impacts the end user by providing them with detailed insights into the performance of their web applications. This can help users identify areas of their application that may be underperforming and need optimization.
