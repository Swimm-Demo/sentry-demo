title: Exploring Performance Monitoring in Views
---
Performance in the 'views' directory of the sentry-demo repository refers to the monitoring and tracking of application performance metrics. It involves capturing data related to the speed, efficiency, and reliability of various aspects of the application.

The 'performance' directory contains various subdirectories and files that handle different aspects of performance monitoring. For instance, the 'landing' subdirectory contains views for different types of transactions, while the 'charts' subdirectory contains components for visualizing performance data.

The 'PerformanceContainer' function in the 'index.tsx' file is a key component in the performance monitoring functionality. It checks for access to the performance feature and renders the appropriate components based on the user's access level.

The 'eventView' constant in the 'content.tsx' file is an important part of the performance monitoring functionality. It is generated by the 'generatePerformanceEventView' function and contains information about the current view of performance data.

The 'QuickTraceMeta' function in the 'quickTraceMeta.tsx' file is another key component in the performance monitoring functionality. It uses the 'useOrganization' and 'getConfigurePerformanceDocsLink' functions to display trace data and provide links to relevant documentation.

# PerformanceContainer Function

The 'PerformanceContainer' function checks for access to the performance feature and renders the appropriate components based on the user's access level. It is a key component in the performance monitoring functionality.

```tsx
import type {Location} from 'history';

import Feature from 'sentry/components/acl/feature';
import {Alert} from 'sentry/components/alert';
import * as Layout from 'sentry/components/layouts/thirds';
import NoProjectMessage from 'sentry/components/noProjectMessage';
import {t} from 'sentry/locale';
import type {Organization} from 'sentry/types/organization';
import {MetricsCardinalityProvider} from 'sentry/utils/performance/contexts/metricsCardinality';
import {MEPSettingProvider} from 'sentry/utils/performance/contexts/metricsEnhancedSetting';
import withOrganization from 'sentry/utils/withOrganization';

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  location: Location;
  organization: Organization;
};

function PerformanceContainer({organization, location, children}: Props) {
  function renderNoAccess() {
    return (

# EventView Constant

The 'eventView' constant is an important part of the performance monitoring functionality. It is generated by the 'generatePerformanceEventView' function and contains information about the current view of performance data.

```tsx
function PerformanceContent({selection, location, demoMode, router}: Props) {
  const api = useApi();
  const organization = useOrganization();
  const {projects} = useProjects();
  const mounted = useRef(false);
  const previousDateTime = usePrevious(selection.datetime);
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>({error: undefined});
  const withStaticFilters = canUseMetricsData(organization);
  const eventView = generatePerformanceEventView(
    location,
    projects,
    {
      withStaticFilters,
    },
    organization
  );

  function getOnboardingProject(): Project | undefined {

# QuickTraceMeta Function

The 'QuickTraceMeta' function uses the 'useOrganization' and 'getConfigurePerformanceDocsLink' functions to display trace data and provide links to relevant documentation. It is a key component in the performance monitoring functionality.

```tsx
export default function QuickTraceMeta({
  event,
  location,
  quickTrace,
  traceMeta,
  anchor,
  errorDest,
  transactionDest,
  project,
}: Props) {
  const organization = useOrganization();
  const features = ['performance-view'];

  const noFeatureMessage = t('Requires performance monitoring.');

  const docsLink = getConfigurePerformanceDocsLink(project);

  const traceId = event.contexts?.trace?.trace_id ?? null;
  let body: React.ReactNode;
  let footer: React.ReactNode;

```
