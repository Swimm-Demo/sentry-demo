title: What is Team Management in Organization Settings
---
Organization teams in Sentry are groups of users within an organization. They are used to manage access to projects and issues within the organization. Each team can have different members and different access rights, which are managed through the 'access' and 'features' properties. The 'access' property is a set of strings representing the access rights of the team, and the 'features' property is a set of strings representing the features available to the team.

The OrganizationTeams function in the 'organizationTeams.tsx' file is the main component for managing teams in an organization. It uses the 'useTeams' hook to fetch the teams from the TeamStore and provides functionality for searching teams, loading more teams, and checking if there are more teams to load. It also checks if the current user has the 'project:admin' access right, which determines if they can create new teams.

The 'teamQuery' state is used to filter the teams based on the user's search input. The 'debouncedSearch' function is used to delay the search action until the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time, to reduce the number of API calls.

The 'action' constant is a Button component that allows the user to create a new team. It is disabled and shows a tooltip if the user does not have the 'project:admin' access right. When clicked, it opens the 'Create Team' modal.

The 'OrganizationTeamsContainer' function in the 'index.tsx' file is the main entry point for the organization teams settings page. It fetches the access requests for the organization and passes them to the 'OrganizationTeams' component. It also provides a 'handleRemoveAccessRequest' function that removes an access request and updates the teams in the TeamStore.

The 'teamSettings' directory contains the 'TeamSettings' component, which is used to manage the settings of a specific team. It uses the 'useOrganization' hook to fetch the current organization and provides functionality for submitting changes to the team settings and removing the team.
