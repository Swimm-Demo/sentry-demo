# Attach Function

The `attach` function is used to run a single devservice in the foreground. It accepts a single argument, the name of the service to spawn. The service will run with output printed to your terminal, and the ability to kill it with ^C. This is used in devserver.

```python

# Patch Transport for Instrumentation

The `patch_transport_for_instrumentation` function is called within `configure_sdk`. It patches the transport functions to add metrics for better resolution around events sent to Sentry's ingest. It does this by wrapping the original `_send_request` method of the transport with a new method that increments a metric before calling the original method.

```python
# Patches transport functions to add metrics to improve resolution around events sent to our ingest.
# Leaving this in to keep a permanent measurement of sdk requests vs ingest.

# Increment Metrics

The `incr` function is used to increment a metric. It is called within `patch_transport_for_instrumentation` and `configure_sdk` to track the number of events and envelopes captured, and the number of requests sent.

```python
    def incr(
        self,
        key: str,
        instance: str | None = None,
        tags: Tags | None = None,

# Get SDK Options

The `_get_sdk_options` function is called within `configure_sdk` to get the options for the Sentry SDK. These options include the DSNs for Sentry and Relay, and various settings for transactions and events.

```python
def _get_sdk_options() -> tuple[SdkConfig, Dsns]:
    sdk_options = settings.SENTRY_SDK_CONFIG.copy()
    sdk_options["send_client_reports"] = True

# Capture Anything

The `_capture_anything` method is part of the `MultiplexingTransport` class defined in `configure_sdk`. It is responsible for capturing any event or envelope and sending it to Sentry.

```python
        def _capture_anything(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
            # Sentry4Sentry (upstream) should get the event first because
            # it is most isolated from the sentry installation.

# \_capture_anything function

The `_capture_anything` function is the starting point of the attach flow. It's responsible for capturing events and metrics. It checks if the `SENTRY_SDK_UPSTREAM_METRICS_ENABLED` setting is enabled and the method name is `capture_envelope`. If these conditions are met, it filters out all the `statsd` envelope items and sends them to the `sentry4sentry_transport`.

```python
        def _capture_anything(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
            # Sentry4Sentry (upstream) should get the event first because
            # it is most isolated from the sentry installation.
            if sentry4sentry_transport:
                metrics.incr("internal.captured.events.upstream")
                # TODO(mattrobenolt): Bring this back safely.
                # from sentry import options
                # install_id = options.get('sentry:install-id')
                # if install_id:

                s4s_args = args
                # We want to control whether we want to send metrics at the s4s upstream.
                if (

# incr function

The `incr` function is called within `_capture_anything` to increment a metric. It takes a key, an optional instance, optional tags, an amount to increment by, and a sample rate. If the metrics system hasn't started yet, it starts it and then puts the metric increment in a queue.

```python
    def put(self, *args, **kwargs):

# copy function

The `copy` function is used within `_capture_anything` to create a copy of the envelope. This is done to ensure that the original envelope and its items are distinct references, which is important when sending metrics to different transports.

```python
        self.backends = backends

    def copy(self) -> Context:
        return Context(self.request, self.backends.copy())

# Context function

The `Context` function is used to create a context for a frame in the user interface. It takes a number of properties related to the frame and event, and uses these to display the context of the frame, including source code, variables, registers, and assembly. It also handles the display of coverage data if available.

```tsx
function Context({
  hasContextVars = false,
  hasContextSource = false,
  hasContextRegisters = false,
  isExpanded = false,
  hasAssembly = false,
  emptySourceNotation = false,
  registers,
  frame,

  className,
  frameMeta,
  registersMeta,
  platform,
}: Props) {
  const organization = useOrganization();

# Increment Metrics

The `incr` function is used to increment a metric. It is called within `patch_transport_for_instrumentation` and `configure_sdk` to track the number of events and envelopes captured, and the number of requests sent.

```python
    def incr(
        self,
        key: str,
        instance: str | None = None,
        tags: Tags | None = None,
        amount: int = 1,
        sample_rate: float = settings.SENTRY_METRICS_SAMPLE_RATE,
    ) -> None:
        if not self._started:
            self._start()
        self.q.put((key, instance, tags, amount, sample_rate))

# Get SDK Options

The `_get_sdk_options` function is called within `configure_sdk` to get the options for the Sentry SDK. These options include the DSNs for Sentry and Relay, and various settings for transactions and events.

```python
def _get_sdk_options() -> tuple[SdkConfig, Dsns]:
    sdk_options = settings.SENTRY_SDK_CONFIG.copy()
    sdk_options["send_client_reports"] = True
    sdk_options["traces_sampler"] = traces_sampler
    sdk_options["before_send_transaction"] = before_send_transaction
    sdk_options["before_send"] = before_send
    sdk_options["release"] = (
        f"backend@{sdk_options['release']}" if "release" in sdk_options else None
    )

    # Modify SENTRY_SDK_CONFIG in your deployment scripts to specify your desired DSN
    dsns = Dsns(
        sentry4sentry=sdk_options.pop("dsn", None),
        sentry_saas=sdk_options.pop("relay_dsn", None),
    )

    return sdk_options, dsns

# Capture Anything

The `_capture_anything` method is part of the `MultiplexingTransport` class defined in `configure_sdk`. It is responsible for capturing any event or envelope and sending it to Sentry.

```python
        def _capture_anything(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
            # Sentry4Sentry (upstream) should get the event first because
            # it is most isolated from the sentry installation.
```

# \_capture_anything function

The `_capture_anything` function is the starting point of the attach flow. It's responsible for capturing events and metrics. It checks if the `SENTRY_SDK_UPSTREAM_METRICS_ENABLED` setting is enabled and the method name is `capture_envelope`. If these conditions are met, it filters out all the `statsd` envelope items and sends them to the `sentry4sentry_transport`.

```python
        def _capture_anything(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
            # Sentry4Sentry (upstream) should get the event first because
            # it is most isolated from the sentry installation.
            if sentry4sentry_transport:
                metrics.incr("internal.captured.events.upstream")
                # TODO(mattrobenolt): Bring this back safely.
                # from sentry import options
                # install_id = options.get('sentry:install-id')
                # if install_id:
                #     event.setdefault('tags', {})['install-id'] = install_id
                s4s_args = args
                # We want to control whether we want to send metrics at the s4s upstream.
                if (
                    not settings.SENTRY_SDK_UPSTREAM_METRICS_ENABLED
                    and method_name == "capture_envelope"
                ):
                    args_list = list(args)
                    envelope = args_list[0]
                    # We filter out all the statsd envelope items, which contain custom metrics sent by the SDK.
                    # unless we allow them via a separate sample rate.
                    safe_items = [

# incr function

The `incr` function is called within `_capture_anything` to increment a metric. It takes a key, an optional instance, optional tags, an amount to increment by, and a sample rate. If the metrics system hasn't started yet, it starts it and then puts the metric increment in a queue.

```python
    def incr(
        self,
        key: str,
        instance: str | None = None,
        tags: Tags | None = None,
        amount: int = 1,
        sample_rate: float = settings.SENTRY_METRICS_SAMPLE_RATE,
    ) -> None:
        if not self._started:
            self._start()
        self.q.put((key, instance, tags, amount, sample_rate))
```

# copy function

The `copy` function is used within `_capture_anything` to create a copy of the envelope. This is done to ensure that the original envelope and its items are distinct references, which is important when sending metrics to different transports.

```python
        self.backends = backends

    def copy(self) -> Context:
        return Context(self.request, self.backends.copy())
```

# Context function

The `Context` function is used to create a context for a frame in the user interface. It takes a number of properties related to the frame and event, and uses these to display the context of the frame, including source code, variables, registers, and assembly. It also handles the display of coverage data if available.

```tsx
function Context({
  hasContextVars = false,
  hasContextSource = false,
  hasContextRegisters = false,
  isExpanded = false,
  hasAssembly = false,
  emptySourceNotation = false,
  registers,
  frame,
  event,
  className,
  frameMeta,
  registersMeta,
  platform,
}: Props) {
  const organization = useOrganization();

  const {projects} = useProjects();
  const project = useMemo(
    () => projects.find(p => p.id === event.projectID),
    [projects, event]
```

# put function

The `put` function is used to make a PUT request. It's a part of the Sentry API client and is used to update resources on the server.

```python
    def put(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.request("PUT", *args, **kwargs)
```
