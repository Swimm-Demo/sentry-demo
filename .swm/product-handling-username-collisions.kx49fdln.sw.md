# Purpose of Handling Username Collisions

In the Sentry platform, each user must have a unique username. This is crucial for ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of errors and performance issues. However, during the user import process, there may be instances where the usernames in the import data match those of existing users. This is what we refer to as a 'username collision'. It's important that we handle these collisions to prevent any disruption to the user experience.

# Identifying Potential Collisions

The first step in handling username collisions is to identify potential collisions. This is done during the user import process. We fetch existing users whose usernames match those found in the import data. This process is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. This ensures that we have a consistent and reliable method of identifying potential collisions.

# Resolving Collisions

Once potential collisions have been identified, we then move on to resolving these collisions. This involves a series of steps, including retrying tasks and exporting user data. If a task fails, it will be retried until the maximum number of attempts is reached. If the task still fails after the maximum number of attempts, the import process will be marked as failed. This ensures that we don't proceed with an import that could potentially disrupt the user experience. As part of this process, we also export the user data within the scope of the import task. This data is encrypted and saved to a specific path in the storage.

# Impact on the End User

The process of handling username collisions is designed to be seamless to the end user. The aim is to ensure that the user experience is not disrupted during the import process. If a collision is identified and resolved successfully, the end user should not notice any change. However, if a collision cannot be resolved, the import process will be marked as failed. This will prevent the import from proceeding, thereby ensuring that the existing user experience is not disrupted.
