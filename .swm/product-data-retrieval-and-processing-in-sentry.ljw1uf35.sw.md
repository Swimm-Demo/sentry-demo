title: product-Data Retrieval and Processing in Sentry
---
This document will cover the process of data retrieval and processing in the Sentry application. We'll cover:

1. The role of the data_fn function in the data retrieval and processing flow.
2. How the data_fn function fetches and processes event data.
3. The process of fetching user tags.
4. The process of fetching unique EventUser objects.
5. The process of copying context data.

# The Role of the data_fn Function

The data_fn function serves as the starting point of the data retrieval and processing flow. It takes an offset and limit as parameters and returns a list of Event objects. The function constructs a query, runs the query, and transforms the results into Event objects. If the full flag is set, the function fetches all the data blobs for NodeDatas of a list of Event objects with a single multi-get command to nodestore, and binds the returned blobs to the NodeDatas.

# Fetching and Processing Event Data

The data_fn function fetches and processes event data from Snuba. It constructs a Snuba query, runs the query, and processes the results into a list of Event objects. If the full parameter in the parent function is set to true, it also binds the results using the bind_nodes function from the eventstore.backend.

# Fetching User Tags

The get_user_tag function is used to fetch the user tag for a given key-value pair. It uses the for_projects method of the EventUser class to fetch the user tag. The for_projects function fetches the EventUser with a Snuba query that exists within a list of projects and valid keyword_filters. It tries to fetch as many unique rows as possible from the query and returns a list of unique EventUser objects.

# Fetching Unique EventUser Objects

The \_find_unique function returns the first instance of an EventUser object with a unique tag_value from the Snuba results. It iterates over the data results and appends unique event users to the result list.

# Copying Context Data

The copy function returns a new Context object with the same request and a copy of the backends. The Context function is a React component that renders the context of a frame in the Sentry UI. It displays the source code, variables, registers, and assembly of the frame based on the provided props.
