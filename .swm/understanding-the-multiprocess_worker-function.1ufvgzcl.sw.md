title: Understanding the multiprocess_worker Function
---
# Overview of multiprocess_worker

The `multiprocess_worker` is a function that serves as the entry point for each worker process in a multiprocess environment. It is responsible for setting up the environment for each worker process and continuously processing tasks from the task queue until a stop signal is received.

<SwmSnippet path="/src/sentry/runner/settings.py" line="53">

---

# Configuration of the Worker Process

The `configure` function is called within `multiprocess_worker` to set up the environment for the worker process. It handles the configuration of the application, including setting up the environment variables, configuring the Django settings module, and initializing the application.

```python
def configure(
    ctx: click.Context | None, py: str, yaml: str | None, skip_service_validation: bool = False
) -> None:
    """
    Given the two different config files, set up the environment.

    NOTE: Will only execute once, so it's safe to call multiple times.
    """
    global __installed
    if __installed:
        return

    # Make sure that our warnings are always displayed.
    warnings.filterwarnings("default", "", Warning, r"^sentry")

    # Add in additional mimetypes that are useful for our static files
    # which aren't common in default system registries
    import mimetypes

    for type, ext in (
        ("application/json", "map"),
```

# Initialization of the Application

The `initialize_app` function is called within `configure` to initialize the application. It handles the application's bootstrap options, configures logging, validates the configuration, and sets up the services.

```python
def initialize_app(config: dict[str, Any], skip_service_validation: bool = False) -> None:
    settings = config["settings"]

    # Just reuse the integration app for Single Org / Self-Hosted as
    # it doesn't make much sense to use 2 separate apps for SSO and
    # integration.
    if settings.SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION:
        options_mapper.update(
            {

    bootstrap_options(settings, config["options"])

    logging.raiseExceptions = settings.DEBUG

# Validation of Snuba

The `validate_snuba` function is called within `initialize_app` to ensure that everything related to Snuba, a column-oriented, distributed data warehouse, is in sync. It checks the configuration and raises errors if the configuration is not compatible with Snuba.

```python
def validate_snuba() -> None:
    """
    Make sure everything related to Snuba is in sync.

    This covers a few cases:

    * When you have features related to Snuba, you must also
      have Snuba fully configured correctly to continue.
    * If you have Snuba specific search/tagstore/tsdb backends,
      you must also have a Snuba compatible eventstream backend
      otherwise no data will be written into Snuba.
    * If you only have Snuba related eventstream, yell that you
      probably want the other backends otherwise things are weird.
    """
    if not settings.DEBUG:
        return

# SDK Configuration

The `configure_sdk` function is the starting point of the flow. It sets up the SDK configuration and initializes the `MultiplexingTransport` class which is responsible for capturing events and envelopes. The `_capture_anything` method within this class is used to capture any type of event or envelope.

```python
def configure_sdk():
    """
    Setup and initialize the Sentry SDK.
    """
    sdk_options, dsns = _get_sdk_options()

    internal_project_key = get_project_key()

        sentry4sentry_transport = patch_transport_for_instrumentation(transport, "upstream")
    else:
        sentry4sentry_transport = None

    if dsns.sentry_saas:
        transport = make_transport(get_options(dsn=dsns.sentry_saas, **sdk_options))

# Incrementing Metrics

The `incr` function is used to increment a metric. It is called within `patch_transport_for_instrumentation` and `configure_sdk` to increment the count of internal captured events and sent requests respectively.

```python
    def incr(
        self,
        key: str,
        instance: str | None = None,
        tags: Tags | None = None,
        amount: int = 1,
        sample_rate: float = settings.SENTRY_METRICS_SAMPLE_RATE,
    ) -> None:
        if not self._started:

# Context Copy

The `copy` function is used to create a copy of the current context. It returns a new `Context` object with the same request and a copy of the backends.

```python
        self.backends = backends

    def copy(self) -> Context:
        return Context(self.request, self.backends.copy())
```

# Context Display

The `Context` function is a React component that displays the context of a frame in an event. It shows the source code, variables, registers, and assembly for the frame. It also fetches and displays coverage data for the frame if available.

```tsx
function Context({
  hasContextVars = false,
  hasContextSource = false,
  hasContextRegisters = false,
  isExpanded = false,
  hasAssembly = false,
  emptySourceNotation = false,
  registers,
  frame,
  event,
  className,
  frameMeta,
  registersMeta,
  platform,
}: Props) {
  const organization = useOrganization();

  const {projects} = useProjects();
  const project = useMemo(
    () => projects.find(p => p.id === event.projectID),
    [projects, event]

# \_capture_anything Function

The `_capture_anything` function is a part of the Sentry SDK. It's responsible for capturing events and metrics. It first checks if the `sentry4sentry_transport` is available, if so, it increments the `internal.captured.events.upstream` metric. It then checks if the `SENTRY_SDK_UPSTREAM_METRICS_ENABLED` setting is disabled and the method name is `capture_envelope`. If these conditions are met, it filters out all the `statsd` envelope items and sends the remaining items to the `sentry4sentry_transport`. If the `sentry_saas_transport` is available and the `store.use-relay-dsn-sample-rate` option is set to 1, it creates a copy of the envelope and its items and sends them to the `sentry_saas_transport`.

```python
        def _capture_anything(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
            # Sentry4Sentry (upstream) should get the event first because
            # it is most isolated from the sentry installation.
            if sentry4sentry_transport:
                metrics.incr("internal.captured.events.upstream")
                # TODO(mattrobenolt): Bring this back safely.
                # from sentry import options

# copy Function

The `copy` function is used to create a copy of the current context. It returns a new `Context` object with the same request and a copy of the backends.

```python
        self.backends = backends

    def copy(self) -> Context:
        return Context(self.request, self.backends.copy())
```

# Context Function

The `Context` function is a React component that displays the context of a frame in an event. It shows the source code, variables, registers, and assembly for the frame. It also fetches and displays coverage data for the frame if available.

```tsx
function Context({
  hasContextVars = false,
  hasContextSource = false,
  hasContextRegisters = false,
  isExpanded = false,
  hasAssembly = false,
  emptySourceNotation = false,
  registers,
  frame,
  event,
  className,
  frameMeta,
  registersMeta,
  platform,
}: Props) {
  const organization = useOrganization();

  const {projects} = useProjects();
  const project = useMemo(
    () => projects.find(p => p.id === event.projectID),
    [projects, event]
```
