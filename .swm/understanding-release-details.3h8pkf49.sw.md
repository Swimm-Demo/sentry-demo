title: Understanding Release Details
---
Detail in the context of Releases refers to the specific information and data associated with a particular release. It includes various aspects such as the version, creation date, first and last events, and source maps. This information is used to provide a comprehensive overview of a release, aiding in understanding its impact and performance.

The Detail is represented in the codebase through various components and functions. For instance, the `ProjectReleaseDetails` function in `projectReleaseDetails.tsx` is used to display the details of a release for a specific project. It uses the `release` and `releaseMeta` props to access and display the release's data.

The `getTitle` function in `index.tsx` is used to generate the title for the release details page. It uses the `release` state and the `selection` prop to find the project associated with the release and then generates the title using the `routeTitleGen` and `formatVersion` functions.

The `ReleasesDetail` class in `index.tsx` is a key component in handling the release details. It fetches the necessary data for the release and handles the rendering of the release details page. It uses the `release` state to store the fetched release data.

The `ReleasesDetailContainer` class in `index.tsx` is a container component for the release details. It fetches the metadata for the release and passes it down to the `ReleasesDetail` component.
