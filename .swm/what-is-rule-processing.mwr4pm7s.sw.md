title: What is Rule Processing
---
Rules in the Sentry application are a set of conditions and actions that are applied to events. They are used to automate responses to specific types of events. For instance, a rule can be set to notify a developer when an event of a certain level occurs.

The 'apply' function in the '[processor.py](http://processor.py)' file is a key part of rule processing. It applies rules to unresolved issues. The function fetches rules, checks if they are snoozed, and applies them if they are not.

The 'apply_delayed' function in the 'delayed_processing.py' file is another important part of rule processing. It fetches rules, groups, and events from the Redis buffer, evaluates the 'slow' conditions in a bulk snuba query, and fires them if they pass.

The 'RuleBase' class in the '[base.py](http://base.py)' file is the base class for all rules. It provides methods for getting rule options, validating forms, rendering labels, and more.

The 'EventState' class in the '[base.py](http://base.py)' file encapsulates the state of an event when a rule is applied. It includes information about whether the event is new, a regression, has reappeared, and more.

The 'EventAction' class in the 'actions/base.py' file is the base class for all rule actions. It provides methods for executing actions after a rule matches.

The 'LevelCondition' class in the 'conditions/level.py' file is a rule condition that checks the level of an event. It provides methods for checking if an event passes the condition and rendering the condition label.

# Applying Rules

The 'apply' function is a key part of rule processing. It applies rules to unresolved issues. The function fetches rules, checks if they are snoozed, and applies them if they are not.

```python
    def apply(
        self,
    ) -> Collection[tuple[Callable[[GroupEvent, Sequence[RuleFuture]], None], list[RuleFuture]]]:
        # we should only apply rules on unresolved issues
        if not self.event.group.is_unresolved():
            return {}.values()

        self.grouped_futures.clear()
        rules = self.get_rules()
        snoozed_rules = RuleSnooze.objects.filter(rule__in=rules, user_id=None).values_list(
            "rule", flat=True
        )
        rule_statuses = bulk_get_rule_status(rules, self.group, self.project)
        for rule in rules:
            if rule.id not in snoozed_rules:
                self.apply_rule(rule, rule_statuses[rule.id])

        return self.grouped_futures.values()
```

# Delayed Rule Application

The 'apply_delayed' function is another important part of rule processing. It fetches rules, groups, and events from the Redis buffer, evaluates the 'slow' conditions in a bulk snuba query, and fires them if they pass.

```python
def apply_delayed(project_id: int, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
    """
    Grab rules, groups, and events from the Redis buffer, evaluate the "slow" conditions in a bulk snuba query, and fire them if they pass
    """
    # STEP 1: Fetch the rulegroup_to_event_data mapping for the project from redis
    project = Project.objects.get_from_cache(id=project_id)
    rulegroup_to_event_data = buffer.backend.get_hash(
        model=Project, field={"project_id": project.id}
    )
    logger.info(
        "delayed_processing.rulegroupeventdata",
        extra={"rulegroupdata": rulegroup_to_event_data, "project_id": project_id},
    )

    # STEP 2: Map each rule to the groups that must be checked for that rule.
    rules_to_groups = get_rules_to_groups(rulegroup_to_event_data)

    # STEP 3: Fetch the Rule models we need to check
    alert_rules_qs = Rule.objects.filter(id__in=list(rules_to_groups.keys()))
    snoozed_rules = set(
        RuleSnooze.objects.filter(rule__in=alert_rules_qs, user_id=None).values_list(

# Rules Endpoints

Endpoints related to Rules

## ProjectRuleGroupHistoryIndexEndpoint

The `ProjectRuleGroupHistoryIndexEndpoint` is a GET endpoint that retrieves the group firing history for an issue alert. It takes the organization ID, project ID, and issue rule ID as parameters. The endpoint fetches the rule groups paginated and returns a response with the serialized results.

```python
class ProjectRuleGroupHistoryIndexEndpoint(RuleEndpoint):
    publish_status = {
        "GET": ApiPublishStatus.EXPERIMENTAL,
    }

    @extend_schema(
        operation_id="Retrieve a Group Firing History for an Issue Alert",
        parameters=[
            GlobalParams.ORG_ID_OR_SLUG,
            GlobalParams.PROJECT_ID_OR_SLUG,
            IssueAlertParams.ISSUE_RULE_ID,
        ],
        responses={
            200: RuleGroupHistorySerializer,
