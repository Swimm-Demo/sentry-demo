# What is PipelineView

`PipelineView` is a class that may be used in a `PipelineProviders`' `get_pipeline_views` list. It is an abstract base class that provides a structure for views in the pipeline.

# Variables and functions

The `dispatch` function is an abstract method that is called on request. The active pipeline is passed in which can and should be used to bind data and traverse the pipeline.

```python
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def dispatch(self, request: Request, pipeline: "Pipeline") -> HttpResponseBase:
        """
        Called on request, the active pipeline is passed in which can and
        should be used to bind data and traverse the pipeline.
        """
```

The `render_react_view` function is a static method that returns a response rendered to a template. It takes in a request, a pipeline name, and props as parameters.

```python
    @staticmethod
    def render_react_view(
        request: Request,
        pipeline_name: str,
        props: Mapping[str, Any],
    ) -> HttpResponseBase:
        return render_to_response(
            template="sentry/bases/react_pipeline.html",
            request=request,
            context={"pipelineName": pipeline_name, "props": json.dumps(props)},
        )
```

# Usage example

The `PipelineView` class is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated directly. However, it can be subclassed. An example of this is the `AccountConfigView` class.
