title: Overview of Team Performance Insights
---
Team Insights in the Organization Stats of the Sentry application provides a detailed view of the performance and health of a team's projects. It is a feature that is accessible to the organization and is used to monitor and track the status of different projects associated with a team.

The Team Insights feature is implemented in various components such as 'issues', 'health', and 'controls'. Each of these components provides different insights related to the team's projects. For instance, 'issues' provides insights into the issues faced by the team's projects, 'health' provides insights into the health status of the team's projects, and 'controls' provides the ability to manipulate the view of these insights.

The Team Insights feature uses the 'organization' constant to fetch the organization's data and the 'localStorageKey' constant to store and retrieve the selected team's ID from the local storage. The 'useRouteAnalyticsEventNames' function is used to track the viewing of the Team Insights feature for analytics purposes.

# Team Insights Container

This is the main container for the Team Insights feature. It wraps the children components with the 'Feature' and 'NoProjectMessage' components. The 'Feature' component checks if the 'team-insights' feature is enabled for the organization. The 'NoProjectMessage' component displays a message when there are no projects for the organization.

```tsx
function TeamInsightsContainer({children, organization}: Props) {
  return (
    <Feature organization={organization} features="team-insights">
      <NoProjectMessage organization={organization}>
        {children && isValidElement(children)
          ? cloneElement<any>(children, {
              organization,
            })
          : (children as React.ReactChild)}
      </NoProjectMessage>
    </Feature>
  );
}

export default withOrganization(TeamInsightsContainer);
```

# Team Insights Issues

This component provides insights into the issues faced by the team's projects. It uses the 'useRouteAnalyticsEventNames' function to track the viewing of the Team Insights feature for analytics purposes. It also uses the 'localStorageKey' constant to retrieve the selected team's ID from the local storage.

```tsx
  const organization = useOrganization();
  const {teams, isLoading, isError} = useUserTeams();

  useRouteAnalyticsEventNames('team_insights.viewed', 'Team Insights: Viewed');

  const query = location?.query ?? {};
  const localStorageKey = `teamInsightsSelectedTeamId:${organization.slug}`;

  let localTeamId: string | null | undefined =
    query.team ?? localStorage.getItem(localStorageKey);
  if (localTeamId && !teams.find(team => team.id === localTeamId)) {
    localTeamId = null;
  }
  const currentTeamId = localTeamId ?? teams[0]?.id;
  const currentTeam = teams.find(team => team.id === currentTeamId) as
    | TeamWithProjects
    | undefined;
  const projects = currentTeam?.projects ?? [];
  const environment = query.environment;

  const {period, start, end, utc} = dataDatetime(query);
```

# Team Insights Health

This component provides insights into the health status of the team's projects. Similar to the 'issues' component, it also uses the 'useRouteAnalyticsEventNames' function and the 'localStorageKey' constant.

```tsx
  const organization = useOrganization();
  const {teams, isLoading, isError} = useUserTeams();

  useRouteAnalyticsEventNames('team_insights.viewed', 'Team Insights: Viewed');

  const query = location?.query ?? {};
  const localStorageKey = `teamInsightsSelectedTeamId:${organization.slug}`;

  let localTeamId: string | null | undefined =
    query.team ?? localStorage.getItem(localStorageKey);
  if (localTeamId && !teams.find(team => team.id === localTeamId)) {
    localTeamId = null;
  }
  const currentTeamId = localTeamId ?? teams[0]?.id;
  const currentTeam = teams.find(team => team.id === currentTeamId) as
    | TeamWithProjects
    | undefined;
  const projects = currentTeam?.projects ?? [];

  const {period, start, end, utc} = dataDatetime(query);

```

# Team Insights Controls

This component provides the ability to manipulate the view of the Team Insights. It uses the 'localStorageKey' constant to store the selected team's ID in the local storage when the team is changed.

```tsx
  const theme = useTheme();

  const query = location?.query ?? {};
  const localStorageKey = `teamInsightsSelectedTeamId:${organization.slug}`;

  function handleChangeTeam(teamId: string) {
    localStorage.setItem(localStorageKey, teamId);
    // TODO(workflow): Preserve environment if it exists for the new team
    setStateOnUrl({team: teamId, environment: undefined});
  }
```

  const organization = useOrganization();
  const {teams, isLoading, isError} = useUserTeams();

  useRouteAnalyticsEventNames('team_insights.viewed', 'Team Insights: Viewed');

  const query = location?.query ?? {};
  const localStorageKey = `teamInsightsSelectedTeamId:${organization.slug}`;

  let localTeamId: string | null | undefined =
    query.team ?? localStorage.getItem(localStorageKey);
  if (localTeamId && !teams.find(team => team.id === localTeamId)) {
    localTeamId = null;
  }
  const currentTeamId = localTeamId ?? teams[0]?.id;
  const currentTeam = teams.find(team => team.id === currentTeamId) as
    | TeamWithProjects
    | undefined;
  const projects = currentTeam?.projects ?? [];
  const environment = query.environment;

  const {period, start, end, utc} = dataDatetime(query);
```
