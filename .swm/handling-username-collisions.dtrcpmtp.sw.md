title: Handling Username Collisions

# Preprocessing Colliding Users

The `preprocessing_colliding_users` function is designed to handle potential username collisions during the import process. It fetches existing users whose usernames match those found in the import data. The function is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

# Preprocessing Colliding Users

The function starts a relocation task with the `start_relocation_task` function. This task is assigned a unique identifier (`uuid`), a task type (`OrderedTask.PREPROCESSING_COLLIDING_USERS`), and a maximum number of attempts (`MAX_FAST_TASK_ATTEMPTS`).

```python
    relocation: Relocation | None
    attempts_left: int
    (relocation, attempts_left) = start_relocation_task(
        uuid=uuid,
        task=OrderedTask.PREPROCESSING_COLLIDING_USERS,
        allowed_task_attempts=MAX_FAST_TASK_ATTEMPTS,
    )
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/sentry/tasks/relocation.py" line="532">

---

The `retry_task_or_fail_relocation` function is used to handle task retries. If the task fails, it will be retried until the maximum number of attempts is reached. If the task still fails after the maximum number of attempts, the relocation process will be marked as failed.

```python
    with retry_task_or_fail_relocation(
        relocation,
        OrderedTask.PREPROCESSING_COLLIDING_USERS,
        attempts_left,
        ERR_PREPROCESSING_INTERNAL,
    ):
```

---

The function then exports the user data within the scope of the relocation task. This data is encrypted and saved to a specific path in the relocation storage.

```python
        kind = RelocationFile.Kind.COLLIDING_USERS_VALIDATION_DATA
        path = f'runs/{uuid}/in/{kind.to_filename("tar")}'
        relocation_storage = get_relocation_storage()
        fp = BytesIO()
        log_gcp_credentials_details(logger)
        export_in_user_scope(
            fp,
            encryptor=GCPKMSEncryptor.from_crypto_key_version(get_default_crypto_key_version()),
            user_filter=set(relocation.want_usernames),
            printer=LoggingPrinter(uuid),
        )
        fp.seek(0)
        relocation_storage.save(path, fp)
```

Finally, the `preprocessing_complete` function is called asynchronously, signaling the completion of the preprocessing step.

```python
    preprocessing_complete.apply_async(args=[uuid])
```
