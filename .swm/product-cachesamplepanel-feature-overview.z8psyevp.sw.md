# Purpose of the CacheSamplePanel

The CacheSamplePanel is a component in the Sentry application that manages the display and interaction of cache samples. It is designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of cache samples, allowing them to easily interact with the data.

# Fetching and Displaying Data

The CacheSamplePanel uses a series of custom hooks to fetch and manipulate data. These hooks fetch different types of data, such as indexed cache spans, span metrics, and metrics. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed in the CacheSamplePanel for the user to view and interact with.

# Handling User Interactions

The CacheSamplePanel is designed to handle various user interactions. This includes changes in search and filter options. When a user makes a change in the search or filter options, the CacheSamplePanel updates the displayed data accordingly, providing the user with the most relevant information.
