    "description": "Sentry Public API",
    "termsOfService": "http://sentry.io/terms/",

# List of Endpoints

The list of endpoints for each resource is defined under the `paths` section in the `openapi.json` file. Each endpoint is associated with a specific resource and has a reference to its detailed definition.

```json
  "paths": {
    "/api/0/teams/{organization_id_or_slug}/{team_id_or_slug}/stats/": {
      "$ref": "paths/teams/stats.json"
    },
    "/api/0/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/eventids/{event_id}/": {
      "$ref": "paths/organizations/event-id-lookup.json"
    },

    },
    "/api/0/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/repos/": {
      "$ref": "paths/organizations/repos.json"
    },
    "/api/0/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/repos/{repo_id}/commits/": {
