title: Introduction to Sentry Apps in Integrations
---
Sentry Apps in the Integrations module are a key part of the Sentry platform. They are used to integrate third-party services into Sentry, enhancing its functionality and user experience. These apps are defined and managed through the `SentryApp` class, which is imported from the `sentry.models.integrations.sentry_app` module in various files within the `src/sentry/api/endpoints/integrations/sentry_apps/` directory.

The `SentryApp` class is used to create, manage, and interact with Sentry Apps. It is used in conjunction with other classes such as `SentryAppInstallation` and `SentryAppCreator` to handle the installation and creation of Sentry Apps respectively.

The `SentryAppInstallation` class, imported from the `sentry.models.integrations.sentry_app_installation` module, is used to manage the installation of Sentry Apps. It is used in various files within the `src/sentry/api/endpoints/integrations/sentry_apps/` directory to handle the installation details of Sentry Apps.

The `SentryAppCreator` class, imported from the `sentry.sentry_apps.apps` module, is used to create new Sentry Apps. It is used in the `src/sentry/api/endpoints/integrations/sentry_apps/index.py` file to handle the creation of Sentry Apps.

The `RpcSentryApp` class, imported from the `sentry.sentry_apps.services.app` module, is used to interact with Sentry Apps. It is used in the `src/sentry/api/endpoints/integrations/sentry_apps/interaction.py` file to handle interactions with Sentry Apps.

## SentryAppDetailsEndpoint

The `SentryAppDetailsEndpoint` class defines the API endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting a specific Sentry App. It uses HTTP methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE to perform these operations. The `get` method retrieves the details of a Sentry App, the `put` method updates the details of a Sentry App, and the `delete` method removes a Sentry App.

```python
@control_silo_endpoint
class SentryAppDetailsEndpoint(SentryAppBaseEndpoint):
    owner = ApiOwner.INTEGRATIONS
    publish_status = {
        "DELETE": ApiPublishStatus.UNKNOWN,
        "GET": ApiPublishStatus.UNKNOWN,
        "PUT": ApiPublishStatus.UNKNOWN,
    }
    permission_classes = (SentryAppDetailsEndpointPermission,)

    def get(self, request: Request, sentry_app) -> Response:
        return Response(serialize(sentry_app, request.user, access=request.access))

    @catch_raised_errors
    def put(self, request: Request, sentry_app) -> Response:
        if sentry_app.metadata.get("partnership_restricted", False):
            return Response(
                {"detail": PARTNERSHIP_RESTRICTED_ERROR_MESSAGE},
                status=403,
            )

## SentryAppInstallationsEndpoint

The `SentryAppInstallationsEndpoint` class defines the API endpoints for retrieving and creating installations of Sentry Apps. The `get` method retrieves all installations of a Sentry App for a specific organization. The `post` method creates a new installation of a Sentry App for a specific organization.

```python
@control_silo_endpoint
class SentryAppInstallationsEndpoint(SentryAppInstallationsBaseEndpoint):
    owner = ApiOwner.INTEGRATIONS
    publish_status = {
        "GET": ApiPublishStatus.UNKNOWN,
        "POST": ApiPublishStatus.UNKNOWN,
    }

    def get(self, request: Request, organization) -> Response:
        queryset = SentryAppInstallation.objects.filter(organization_id=organization.id)

        return self.paginate(
            request=request,
            queryset=queryset,
            order_by="-date_added",
            paginator_cls=OffsetPaginator,
            on_results=lambda x: serialize(x, request.user, access=request.access),
        )
