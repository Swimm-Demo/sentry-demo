title: Exploring Issue Groups in Components
---
In the sentry-demo project, 'Group' is a type used in various components within the 'group' directory. It represents a logical grouping of related issues or events. The 'Group' type is used as a prop in several components, indicating that these components are designed to handle or manipulate groups of issues or events in some way.

For instance, in the 'AssignedToProps' interface in 'assignedTo.tsx', 'Group' is one of the properties. This suggests that the component is associated with a specific group of issues or events. Similarly, in 'externalIssuesList/types.tsx', 'Group' is used as a property in the 'IntegrationComponent' and 'PluginIssueComponent' interfaces, indicating that these components are designed to work with a specific group of issues or events.

In 'issueReplayCount.tsx', the 'Group' type is used to fetch the replay count for a specific issue group. This indicates that the 'Group' type is not just used for grouping issues or events, but also for performing operations related to those groups, such as fetching related data.
