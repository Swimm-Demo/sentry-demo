title: Introduction to Rest Framework Serializers
---
The Rest framework, specifically the serializers module, is utilized extensively in the sentry-demo project. It is imported in various files within the 'src/sentry/api/serializers/rest_framework' directory. Serializers in the Rest framework are responsible for transforming complex data types, like querysets and model instances, into native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. In the context of this project, serializers are used to convert model instances and querysets into a format that can be used in the API responses.

# Usage of Rest Framework Serializers

Here, the serializers module from the Rest framework is imported for use in the [mentions.py](http://mentions.py) file.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
```

# Rest Framework Functions

The Rest framework provides several key functionalities that are used in this project. Some of the main ones include Serializer, ListField, CamelSnakeSerializer, and convert_dict_key_case.

## Serializer

The `Serializer` class in the Rest framework is a fundamental building block of DRF. It provides a way of serializing and deserializing complex data types into Python native datatypes that can be rendered into JSON or other content types. In this project, it is used to serialize the data of the Sentry app.

```python
from jsonschema.exceptions import ValidationError as SchemaValidationError
from rest_framework import serializers
from rest_framework.serializers import Serializer, ValidationError

from sentry.api.fields.avatar import AvatarField
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/sentry/api/serializers/rest_framework/group_notes.py" line="1">

---

## ListField

The `ListField` is a serializer field that deals with lists. It is used in this project to handle fields that are lists in the Group Notes feature.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from rest_framework.serializers import ListField

from sentry.api.fields.actor import ActorField
from sentry.api.serializers.rest_framework.mentions import MentionsMixin
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/sentry/api/serializers/rest_framework/dashboard.py" line="10">

---

## CamelSnakeSerializer

The `CamelSnakeSerializer` is a custom serializer used in this project. It appears to handle the conversion between camel case and snake case, which are two common ways of naming variables and keys in programming.

```python
from sentry import features, options
from sentry.api.issue_search import parse_search_query
from sentry.api.serializers.rest_framework import CamelSnakeSerializer
from sentry.api.serializers.rest_framework.base import convert_dict_key_case, snake_to_camel_case
from sentry.constants import ALL_ACCESS_PROJECTS
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/src/sentry/api/serializers/rest_framework/dashboard.py" line="11">

---

## convert_dict_key_case

The `convert_dict_key_case` function is used to convert the keys of a dictionary from one case to another. This is useful when dealing with data that may be in a different case format.

```python
from sentry.api.issue_search import parse_search_query
from sentry.api.serializers.rest_framework import CamelSnakeSerializer
from sentry.api.serializers.rest_framework.base import convert_dict_key_case, snake_to_camel_case
from sentry.constants import ALL_ACCESS_PROJECTS
from sentry.discover.arithmetic import ArithmeticError, categorize_columns
```
