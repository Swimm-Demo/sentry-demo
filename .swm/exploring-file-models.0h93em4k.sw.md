title: Exploring File Models
---
Files in the Models directory of the sentry-demo repository refer to the various Python classes and types that represent different types of file-related data and operations. These include abstract classes like `AbstractFile` and `AbstractFileBlob` which define common properties and methods for file-related objects, and specific classes like `FileBlob` and `ControlFileBlob` which extend these abstract classes for specific use cases.

The `FileModelT` is a type variable used to denote a type that is a subtype of `AbstractFileBlob`. This is used in function signatures to indicate that the function can accept or return an instance of `AbstractFileBlob` or any of its subclasses.

The `AbstractFile` class represents a file in the system. It has properties like `name`, `type`, `timestamp`, `headers`, `size`, and `checksum`. It also has methods for getting a file object (`getfile`), saving the file to a certain location (`save_to`), and saving a file object into a number of chunks (`putfile`).

The `FileBlob` and `ControlFileBlob` classes represent specific types of files in the system. They extend the `AbstractFileBlob` class and add additional properties and methods specific to their use cases.

# File Classes

The `File` class represents a file in the system. It has properties like `blobs`, `blob`, and `path`. It also has constants like `FILE_BLOB_MODEL`, `FILE_BLOB_INDEX_MODEL`, and `DELETE_UNREFERENCED_BLOB_TASK`.

```python
class File(AbstractFile):

    blobs = models.ManyToManyField("sentry.FileBlob", through="sentry.FileBlobIndex")
    # <Legacy fields>
    # Remove in 8.1
    blob = FlexibleForeignKey("sentry.FileBlob", null=True, related_name="legacy_blob")
    path = models.TextField(null=True)
    # </Legacy fields>

    class Meta:
        app_label = "sentry"
        db_table = "sentry_file"

    FILE_BLOB_MODEL = FileBlob
    FILE_BLOB_INDEX_MODEL = FileBlobIndex
    DELETE_UNREFERENCED_BLOB_TASK = delete_unreferenced_blobs_region
```

# File Methods

The `getfile` method is used to return a file-like object for a file's content. It uses the `get_storage` function to get the storage backend and then opens the file.

```python
    def getfile(self):
        """
        Return a file-like object for this File's content.

        >>> with blob.getfile() as src, open('/tmp/localfile', 'wb') as dst:
        >>>     for chunk in src.chunks():
        >>>         dst.write(chunk)
        """
        assert self.path

        storage = get_storage(self._storage_config())
        return storage.open(self.path)
```

The `from_files` method is used to upload files. It takes a list of files and an optional organization and logger. It uses several helper functions to upload and save the file blobs.

```python
    def from_files(cls, files, organization=None, logger=nooplogger):
        """A faster version of `from_file` for multiple files at the time.
        If an organization is provided it will also create `FileBlobOwner`
        entries.  Files can be a list of files or tuples of file and checksum.
        If both are provided then a checksum check is performed.

        If the checksums mismatch an `IOError` is raised.
        """
        logger.debug("FileBlob.from_files.start")

        files_with_checksums = []
        for fileobj in files:
            if isinstance(fileobj, tuple):
                files_with_checksums.append(fileobj)
            else:
                files_with_checksums.append((fileobj, None))

        checksums_seen = set()
        blobs_to_save = []
        semaphore = Semaphore(value=MULTI_BLOB_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY)

```
