title: Understanding process_clock_task

# Overview of process_clock_task

The `process_clock_task` is a function that serves as the entry point for processing clock tasks. It decodes the incoming message and, based on the type of task, it either calls `mark_checkin_timeout` or `mark_environment_missing`.

# mark_checkin_timeout

The `mark_checkin_timeout` function is called when a timeout is detected for a check-in. It updates the status of the check-in to TIMEOUT and if there are no newer check-ins, it calls `mark_failed` to mark the monitor as failed.

# mark_environment_missing

The `mark_environment_missing` function is called when a check-in is missed for a monitor environment. It creates a missed check-in and then calls `mark_failed` to mark the monitor as failed.

# mark_failed

The `mark_failed` function is called when a check-in fails. It updates the monitor environment to failed and triggers side effects for creating monitor incidents and issues.

The `mark_environment_missing` function is called when a check-in is missed for a monitor environment. It creates a missed check-in and then calls `mark_failed` to mark the monitor as failed.

```python

            # not already move the next_checkin_latest forward. This can happen
            # when the clock-ticks happen rapidly and we fire off
            # dispatch_check_missing rapidly (due to a backlog in the

        )

        # (or the environment was deleted)
        return

    monitor = monitor_environment.monitor
    # next_checkin must be set, since detecting this monitor as missed means

# mark_failed

The `mark_failed` function is called when a check-in fails. It updates the monitor environment to failed and triggers side effects for creating monitor incidents and issues.

```python
def mark_failed(
    failed_checkin: MonitorCheckIn,
    ts: datetime,
    received: datetime | None = None,
):
    """
    Given a failing check-in, mark the monitor environment as failed and trigger
    side effects for creating monitor incidents and issues.

    The provided `ts` is the reference time for when the next check-in time is
    calculated from. This typically would be the failed check-in's `date_added`
    or completion time. Though for the missed and timedout tasks this may be
    computed based on the tasks reference time.
    """
    monitor_env = failed_checkin.monitor_environment
    failure_issue_threshold = monitor_env.monitor.config.get("failure_issue_threshold", 1)
    if not failure_issue_threshold:
        failure_issue_threshold = 1

    # Compute the next check-in time from our reference time
    next_checkin = monitor_env.monitor.get_next_expected_checkin(ts)
