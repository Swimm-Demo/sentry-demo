title: Delving into Sentrys Testing Suite and QA Practices
---
This document will cover the topic of testing in `.spec.tsx` files and how code quality assurance is maintained in the project. We'll cover:

1. What's being tested in the `.spec.tsx` files
2. How is code quality assurance maintained in the project.

# What's being tested in the `.spec.tsx` files

This file contains a series of tests for the `countColumns` function. The function is tested with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios.

```tsx
describe('countColumns', () => {
  it('should divide 27s by 2700px to find twentyseven 1s columns, with some fraction remaining', () => {
    // 2700 allows for up to 27 columns at 100px wide.
    // That is what we'd need if we were to render at `1s` granularity, so we can.
    const width = 2700;

    const duration = 27 * SECOND;
    const minWidth = 100;
    const {timespan, cols, remaining} = countColumns(duration, width, minWidth);

    expect(timespan).toBe(1 * SECOND);
    expect(cols).toBe(27);
    expect(remaining).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should divide 27s by 2699px to find five 5s columns, with some fraction remaining', () => {
    // 2699px allows for up to 26 columns at 100px wide, with 99px leftover.
    // That is less than the 27 cols we'd need if we were to render at `1s` granularity.
    // So instead we get 5 cols (wider than 100px) at 5s granularity, and some extra space is remaining.
    const width = 2699;

# How is code quality assurance maintained in the project

This file contains tests for the API client. It verifies that the client behaves as expected under different conditions, ensuring the quality of the API interactions in the project.

```tsx
jest.unmock('sentry/api');

describe('api', function () {
  let api;
