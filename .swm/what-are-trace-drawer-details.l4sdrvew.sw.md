title: What are Trace Drawer Details
---
Details in the Trace drawer refer to the specific information about a trace or span in the Sentry application. This information is organized into different sections, each represented by a TypeScript (tsx) file in the 'details' directory. These sections include transaction details, span details, profiling details, and issues related to the trace or span.

The 'TraceDrawerComponents' constant in 'styles.tsx' file is a collection of styled components used across different sections of the Trace drawer. This constant is imported and used in various files within the 'details' directory to maintain a consistent look and feel across the Trace drawer.

Each section in the Trace drawer provides specific details about a trace or span. For example, the 'transaction' directory contains sections like 'opsBreakDown', 'request', 'breadCrumbs', 'measurements', and others. Each of these sections provides specific details about a transaction in the trace.

Similarly, the 'span' directory contains sections like 'description', 'tags', 'ancestry', 'alerts', 'http', and others. Each of these sections provides specific details about a span in the trace.

The 'profiling' directory contains a 'profilePreview.tsx' file, which is used to display a preview of the profiling data for a trace.

The 'issues' directory contains files that handle the display of issues related to a trace or span. The 'issues.tsx' file lists the issues, while the 'issueSummary.tsx' file provides a summary of each issue.
