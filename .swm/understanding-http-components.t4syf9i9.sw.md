title: Understanding Http Components
---
Components in the Http directory of the sentry-demo repository are primarily used for building the user interface of the HTTP insights view. They are structured as React components and styled-components, which are used to apply CSS in JS. These components include panels, tables, charts, and various UI elements such as headers and links.

For instance, the HTTPSamplesPanel component is a significant part of the HTTP insights view. It fetches and displays HTTP transaction data, including metrics like requests per minute, average duration, and response codes. It also provides functionality for user interactions such as filtering and navigation.

Another example is the Title component, which is a styled-component used to display the title of the HTTP insights view. It is designed to handle long text gracefully by applying CSS properties like overflow, text-overflow, and white-space.

The components are tested using Jest, as seen in the httpSamplesPanel.spec.tsx file. The tests ensure that the components fetch and display the correct data, respond to user interactions as expected, and render correctly.
