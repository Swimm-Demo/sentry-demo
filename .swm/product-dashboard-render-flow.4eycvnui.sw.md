# Render Flow Initiation

The render flow is initiated by the `render` function. This function checks certain conditions and based on them, it decides which function to call next. It can either call `renderWidgetBuilder`, `renderDashboardDetail`, or `renderDefaultDashboardDetail`.

# Dashboard Rendering Decision

The `renderDefaultDashboardDetail` function is responsible for rendering the default dashboard. This function is called when the organization does not have the 'dashboards-edit' feature. The `renderDashboardDetail` function prepares the necessary data and state for rendering the dashboard details. It also generates the performance event view and checks if the dashboard is using transactions.

# Dashboard Deletion

The `onDelete` function is triggered when a user wants to delete a dashboard. It sends a DELETE request to the server and updates the component's state based on the response.

# Dashboard Update

The `updateDashboard` function is called within `renderDashboardDetail`. It sends a PUT request to the server to update the dashboard details. The updated dashboard details are then returned as a promise.

# Performance Event View Generation

The `generatePerformanceEventView` function generates a generic performance event view and then, based on the landing display field, it calls the appropriate function to generate a specific performance event view. These specific performance event view generation functions include `generateMobilePerformanceEventView`, `generateFrontendPageloadPerformanceEventView`, `generateFrontendOtherPerformanceEventView`, `generateBackendPerformanceEventView`, and `generateGenericPerformanceEventView`.

# Finalizing the Render Flow

The `fromNewQueryWithLocation` method in the `EventView` class is used to create an `EventView` instance from a new query and location. It applies global selection header values from the location to the new query. This marks the end of the render flow.
